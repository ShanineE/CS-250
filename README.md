To interpret user needs, meeting with the users and discussing their requirements and requests is important. The requirements need to be prioritized and this will determine how the program will be created and which request will be incorporated into the program. When starting the development of a program I will incorporate a team charter document, this will provide an overview of the client's request, what is needed from myself and my team, and how we will approach the project. To be a good team member means to hold yourself as well as your team members accountable for the creation and deployment of a successful program.
